# event-classification
Jets substructure are used to probe properties of strong interaction, as well as search for the presence of new particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and at the European Center of Nuclear Research (CERN). In order to assess if a jet originated from quark or gluon, several observables sensitive to internal (sub)structure of the jets have been proposed. In this essay, we seek to develop a machine learning tool to classify events based on their origin, given a set of jets observables.
